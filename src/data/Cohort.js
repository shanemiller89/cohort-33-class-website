My original background was graphic design, but after freelancing, I found out I'd rather be the one creating the interface than designing it, and I couldn't be happier with my choice! "

When my former company decided to implement a new WMS system I was once again in the middle of a world of incredibly useful, interesting, and mysterious technology. It was from that experience that I really started to ask myself if this was something that I could dive myself into and find a sense of fulfillment. As you can see I clearly came to the answer that, yes, it was. I am ready to continue this journey of learning, challenges, and creating things that help people with their lives and businesses. `
